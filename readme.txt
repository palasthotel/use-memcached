== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to configure something? =

If you are using a Memcached service with default values host 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and port 11211 or you are hosting with freistil.it than you don't need to configure anything.

With other hosters or service settings you need to configure some php variables in wp-config.php file.
